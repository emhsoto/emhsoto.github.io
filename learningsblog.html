                    <p class="mb-30">My first internship was for the library at UCSD and there I was a learning spaces consultant and I took care of tier one IT support and just library protocol. Many of the questions I would get is to help them find their files that they said was just there yesterday. But what they did not understand was that when they saved their work they were not saving it on their profiles which are stored on the server, they were saving them locally on the computer and thinking that if they signed in a different computer on campus that it would still be there. So, I would show them how to properly save their files and also told them having a USB drive was always smart so that you can have a backup in case you ran into these types of issues. We also took care of the tech room which had 4k monitors, virtual reality googles, 3d printers, and high-end drawing boards. There we would help students whenever they had questions usually tier 1 level and we would also run through the basics of these devices. I enjoyed this internship as I was able to learn many new things and meet lots of other students. This also help me land my second internship.  </p>
