                    <p class="mb-30">When I started UCSD the first thing that I asked myself was why am I one of the only Latinos here. I never 
                      looked at the ethnicity statistics and did not know the culture shock that was about to hit me. I did not feel welcome there 
                      and I felt alone. I also learned how much harder the quarter system is compared to the semester system. My grades did suffer 
                      a little the first semester, but I adapted quickly. San Diego is beautiful, and I loved exploring the city and county. There 
                      is where I learned what I like to do work on computer hardware and software and it wasn’t till that moment I knew I had chosen 
                      the wrong major. I tried changing majors there, but I did not meet the requirements of the impacted major. So I just decided to 
                      finish what I started and start taking classes in computer science and I would take as many as I could and finish somewhere else 
                      after I finished my BA in political science. I know looked back and thought COS doesn’t even have a CS degree, so I would have 
                      never found my niche there. I ended up taking 5 CS courses there and I also landed some internships in Information Technology and
                       was happy about what I was accomplishing. As soon as I graduated I was able to find work and that is what I do now while taking 
                       courses to get my AS in computer science.</p>
